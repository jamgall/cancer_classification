# Tumor Classification
## By: James Gallmeister

This repo utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and seeks to do some introductory exploratory data analysis.
I have done some statistical analysis on some select features such as plotting density histograms for benign vs. malignant tumors to see any obvious differences in feature values. I have begun to do some machine learning on this dataset to try and train various classifiers on the data to find the best one. 

In the future, I hope to do more analysis such as computing confidence intervals at various degrees of confidence and begin tuning the hyper-parameters for the machine learning models that do relatively well in the intitial tests.
